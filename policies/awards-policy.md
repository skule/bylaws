# General

## Scope
1. This Policy describes the process for selecting recipients of Engineering Society awards.
1. The Awards Committee is an ad-hoc committee and is *not* a committee of the Board of Directors. Awards are considered part of the executive authority of the Officers; this policy serves to suggest how that authority should be exercised.
1. This Policy pertains only to the awards listed in Chapter 1, and not the OSOTF "Engineering Society Award" in-course scholarship.

## Awards Committee
1. The Awards Committee shall consist of the following members:
   1. One Member from each year, including PEY;
   1. One Chair of each Discipline Club, or a member of their discipline designated by them;
   1. The Officers of the Society; and
   1. The Business Manager.
1. The President shall chair the committee. Alternatively, they may designate any other person as Chair. If that person is not otherwise a member of the committee, they will be an additional nonvoting member.
1. There shall be an open call for applications to fill the year representative positions on the committee. The application period should last at least one week. Committee members will be selected by the Officers by a method that they shall determine.
1. The committee shall be responsible for deciding the recipients of the awards listed in Chapter 1.

## Nominations
1. The committee shall only consider award candidates who have been duly nominated.
1. All complete nominations must include:
   1. the name of the nominator,
   1. the name of the nominee,
   1. the award for which they are being nominated, and
   1. the reasons supporting the nomination.
1. The nomination period shall begin no later than the Monday of the first week of March and stay open for at least 2 weeks.
1. Notice regarding the opening of the nomination period shall be sent out by email to the entire student body and by at least one other form of communication (posted notice, social media, etc.) at least two days prior to the opening of the nomination period.
1. Nomination forms shall be made available online throughout the nomination period.
1. Nominees may be nominated for multiple awards if they meet the criteria.
1. All nominations shall be kept confidential. The committee shall not be given the names of the nominators.

## Award Selection
1. The committee shall meet after the close of the nomination period to select the recipients of awards.
1. Absentee voting or voting by proxy is not permitted.
1. The chair of the committee may only vote to break a tie, unless they are a non-voting member in which case they may not vote.
1. Any member of the committee who is nominated for an award, or who is an executive of a group which is nominated for an award, shall recuse themselves from the discussion and voting on the respective award.
1. Quorum for the committee is a majority.
1. Awards shall be determined as if a resolution under [section 0.6 of the Standing Rules of Order](../standing-rules.md) had been adopted, with the chair of the committee substituted for the Speaker of the Board.
1. The decisions of the committee are confidential until the awards ceremony.
