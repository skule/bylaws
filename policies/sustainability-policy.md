   1. Establishing formal channels through which students may ask questions and raise comments and concerns regarding environmental practices at the University of Toronto Engineering Society, the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, and broadly, the University of Toronto.

## Definitions

1. The Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering shall be referred to as the “Faculty.”
1. The University of Toronto shall be referred to as the “University.”

# Method of Proposing Initiatives

## General
1. Any constituent who observes a need for new or revised sustainability policies, an opportunity to promote sustainability and stewardship in academic courses, or action targeting generally unsustainable practices pertaining to Engineering Society, Faculty, University, or other student group activities may move to address this need through a Sustainability Directorship initiative.
   1. Constituents may propose the establishment of a new initiative to the Sustainability Director or a representative of the Sustainability Directorship.
   1. It is the responsibility of the Director (and representatives of the Directorship) to inform constituents of their right to raise an official complaint with the Engineering Society Ombudsperson, should the constituent deem the concern serious enough.
   1. Refer to Chapter 3 on how constituents should contact the Sustainability Director.
1. When a proposal is brought forward, the Director and/or the President will decide on whether to approve the the initiative based on:
   1. The merits of the proposal,
   1. The perceived benefits of the initiative,
   1. The current initiatives at hand, and
   1. The available resources at the Sustainability Directorship.
1. The Sustainability Director, having made a decision, may choose to:
   1. Approve the initiative with no additional resources required. In this case, the constituent who filed the proposal may exercise their right to participate in the initiative.
   1. Approve the initiative with additional resources required. In this case, the constituent who filed the proposal may exercise their right to participate in the initiative.
   1. Table the initiative as a future pursuit. Once tabled, the initiative expires if not approved within twelve months or the basis of the initiative is no longer valid.
   1. Reject the initiative on the basis of a lack of resources at the Sustainability Directorship.
   1. Reject the initiative on the basis that it is beyond the scope of the Sustainability Directorship. If applicable, the Sustainability Director may refer the initiative to another body within the Engineering Society for consideration.
1. The Sustainability Director (and broadly the Sustainability Directorship) may be instructed by the Board of Directors or the Ombudsperson to do any or all of the following as a result of a complaint filed with the Ombudsperson:
   1. Conduct an investigation (alongside the Ombudsperson and other relevant entities) into the activities/practices that warranted the complaint.
   1. Create a report on the findings of the above investigation or on the complaint filed to the Ombudsperson.
   1. Take on a new initiative as a resolution to a complaint made to the Ombudsperson.
