## Standing

1. A member has the floor when recognized by the Speaker, and does not have to stand up.

## In-Camera Session

1. The motion to enter an *in camera* session (or to “move *in camera*”) is a privileged motion that:
   1. takes precedence of all others except the privileged motions to take a recess, to adjourn, and to fix the time to which to adjourn, to which it yields;
   1. requires a majority vote;
   1. is in order only when not already *in camera*;
   1. is amendable only as to the additional persons permitted to remain during the *in camera* session;
   1. may be renewed as frequently as the motion to adjourn;
   1. requires no second;
   1. is debatable only as to the anticipated need for secrecy;
   1. cannot be reconsidered; and
   1. is out of order when another has the floor.
1. The motion to leave an *in camera* session (or to “move *ex camera*”) is a privileged motion that:
   1. takes precedence of all others except the motion to enter an *in camera* session and those to which that motion yields, to which it yields;
   1. requires a majority vote;
   1. is in order only when made *in camera*;
   1. is not amendable;
   1. may be renewed as frequently as the motion to adjourn;
   1. requires no second;
   1. is debatable only as to the continued need (or lack thereof) for secrecy;
   1. cannot be reconsidered; and
   1. is out of order when another has the floor.
1. The members of the assembly who are permitted to vote on the secret business to be discussed *in camera*, and the chair and secretary of the meeting, are always permitted to remain in an *in camera* session.
   1. If it is desired to exclude a voting member of the assembly, they must first be barred from voting on the secret business.
   1. If it is desired to exclude the chair or secretary, an interim chair or secretary must first be elected.
1. If the motion to enter an *in camera* session is adopted:
   1. when another question is before the assembly, the *in camera* session automatically ends when the pending main motion is disposed of, if not already ended;
   1. otherwise, the *in camera* session ends only by motion.
1. When a motion to enter an *in camera* session is adopted:
   1. All persons not permitted to remain must leave the room.
   1. The chair shall then prompt for a motion to leave the *in camera* session, in case the reasons for moving *in camera* were, themselves, secret.
1. When a motion to leave an *in camera* session is adopted:
   1. The *in camera* session ends immediately.
   1. Any persons previously required to leave should be invited to return.
1. Minutes are still kept during *in camera* sessions, but they shall not normally be published, and members permitted to remain are obliged to not divulge discussions made *in camera*.
   1. Notwithstanding the above, a motion disposed of *in camera* must have its text and disposition published, unless its text was never publicized *ex camera* and implementing its effects does not require disclosing its disposition.
1. These standing rules on *in camera* sessions replace the provisions of Robert’s Rules relating to executive sessions.
1. While the correct Latin pronunciation of *camera* is /ˈkamera/, in the Engineering Society the word is pronounced [kʰ(ə)ˈmɛɹə], for historical reasons.

## Speaking Limits

1. Members are permitted to speak any number of times and for any duration to a single motion, unless, by motion, the assembly adopts limits on debate.

## Submission of Documents

1. All documents, reports, and appendices shall be submitted at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the commencement of each regular meeting of the Board of Directors, unless otherwise specified in the Bylaws or barring extraneous circumstances at the discretion of the Speaker.

## Reports and Discussion Items

1. Members may submit discussion items for inclusion on the agenda. These are treated the same as regular main motions, with the following exceptions:
   1. The Speaker need not read out the text of a discussion item, only announce that it has commenced.
   1. No text may be submitted with a discussion item other than the topic of discussion (no WHEREAS clauses or resolutions).
   1. No seconder is required (but a member may move to object to the consideration of the item as usual).
   1. No voting is done and no action results from the conclusion of the discussion (but members may make main motions as a result of the discussion, as usual).
   1. There being no resulting action, discussion items are unamendable.
   1. There being no voting, discussion items may not be reconsidered or indefinitely postponed.
   1. There being no "question", the motion to "call the question" may also be termed the motion to "end discussion", and its effect is simply to close debate, not prompt a vote.
1. Reports are a special form of discussion item with precedence on the agenda as outlined in section 0.0.
   1. Reports may only be submitted when demanded by Bylaws, Policies, or motion of the Executive Committee, the Board, or a General Meeting.
   1. The proper form of a report is "REPORT by (reporter)" or "REPORT by (reporter) on (topic)".
1. The proper form of all other discussion items is "DISCUSSION by (submitter) on (topic)".

## Elections by Resolution

1. When a resolution directs the Speaker to conduct "the nominations and election process" (henceforth a "motion to conduct elections") for one or more positions, the process in question is the one described below in this section, unless a different process specified in the Bylaws applies.
   1. If such resolution directs a person other than the Speaker to do so, the same process applies, with references to the Speaker substituted by the person directed.
1. If no nominees were specified by the motion to conduct elections or any appendices, the Speaker shall first call for nominations.
   1. Any eligible candidate may nominate themself, without requiring a second.
   1. Any Member may nominate any eligible candidate who accepts the nomination.
   1. The Speaker shall continue to prompt for nominations until none are supplied.
1. After nominations have been made, the Speaker shall offer each nominee the opportunity to speak for their candidacy.
   1. The order of the speeches is at the Speaker's discretion.
   1. Candidates nominated by others may yield their speech to their nominator, with the latter's consent.
   1. The length of the speeches may be limited by the Bylaws or else at the Speaker's discretion.
   1. The Speaker may at their discretion allow time for questions to candidates.
1. After speeches and questions, the Speaker:
   1. shall send all candidates out of the (physical or online) room, in the process barring any voters who are also candidates from voting, and
   1. may allow time for discussion of candidates.
1. After any discussion has concluded:
   1. The Speaker may, at their discretion based on the discussion or on previous rounds of voting, ask for objections to the election of a particular set of candidates.
      1. If there are no objections from voters, that set shall be elected and the election ends.
      1. If any voter objects, section 0.6.5.b onwards shall proceed as normal.
   1. The Speaker shall prompt for, and record, votes for each candidate, votes to reopen nominations, and abstentions.
   1. If a candidate receives a majority, they shall be elected and removed from consideration.
   1. If "reopen nominations" receives a majority, any remaining vacant positions shall remain vacant, and the election ends.
   1. If no option receives a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes shall be removed from consideration.
   1. If vacant positions remain after electing or eliminating a candidate, then the process shall be repeated from section 0.6.5.a.
1. An affirmative vote on the motion to conduct elections may not be reconsidered.
1. A negative vote on the motion to conduct elections leaves the positions vacant.
