\section{Voting Provisions}
\begin{easylist}
\ListProperties(Start2=0)
&& General
	&&& Voters shall rank candidates on their ballot in order of preference. Voters may rank as many candidates as they prefer.
	&&& There shall be a ``Re-Open Nominations'' option on each ballot.
	&&& Ballots that contain a mark for only one candidate shall be considered to contain a single first-place vote for that candidate.
	&&& The following elections shall be held under a Gregory method of Single Transferable Vote system: Officers, Board of Directors, Discipline Club Chairs, Class Representatives, and any other electronic elections at the discretion of the CRO, as described in Section 11.1.
&& Voting Method
	&&& Each voter's first preference candidate receives one (1) vote.
	&&& The quota of votes needed to win is calculated using the Droop quota, (N/(S+1)))+1, where N is the number of valid first-preference votes in the first round and S is the total number of seats needed to be filled in the election (i.e., fractional votes are dropped). The quota does not change through subsequent rounds.
	&&& If, after all the votes have been transferred, a candidate achieves the quota, then:
		&&&& They are elected to a seat and are ineligible to receive any more votes.
		&&&& Their votes are transferred to the voter's next preference at a value of V(C-Q)/C where V is the value of the vote when the candidate was elected, C is the candidate's vote-total when elected, and Q is quota.
	&&& If, after all the votes have been transferred, no candidate achieves the quota, then:
		&&&& Each candidate with the lowest vote-total is eliminated, and they are ineligible to receive any additional votes. If there is a tie in the process of elimination, a backwards tie-breaking procedure will be performed to determine the candidate that is eliminated. A backwards tie-breaking procedure views the previous stages in a sequential order and eliminates candidates based on those vote totals.
		&&&& Each voter's vote (which was cast for these candidates) remains at its present value.
	&&& Each vote that belonged to the eliminated or elected candidate(s) is transferred to the voter's next preference at its present value.
		&&&& If this candidate is one who was previously eliminated or elected, Section 11.1.5. is repeated.
		&&&& If the voter has not listed any additional preference or was unable to do so, their ballot is exhausted.
	&&& Section 11.1.3. through 11.1.5. are repeated until:
		&&&& All of the seats are filled by election; or
		&&&& At the end of Section 11.1.4., if the number of eligible candidates is equal to or less than the number of unfilled seats and there is no candidate who can reach the quota, then the election is stopped and those seats are considered vacant and a by-election is held immediately following with the timeline at the CRO's discretion.
	&&& If "Re-Open Nominations" receives equal to or more than Q votes, the election iterations are stopped and the unfilled seats are reopened in a by-election.
	&&& In the event a candidate withdraws or is disqualified between the start of the voting period and the ratification of election results:
		&&&& Any votes cast where the candidate was the first-preference and there were no further preferences stated will be nullified and will not count towards the quota.
		&&&& Any votes cast where the candidate was the first-preference and there were further preferences stated will be adjusted such that the second-preference becomes first preference and so on.
		&&&& Any votes cast where the candidate was not the first-preference will be adjusted such that the candidate is removed from their vote and all preferences stated below them move up the order.
