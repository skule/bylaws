	&&& Voters shall rank candidates on their ballot in order of preference. Voters may rank as many candidates as they prefer.

		&&&& The quota of votes needed to win is calculated using the Droop quota, 
(N/(S+1)) + 1, where N is the number of valid first preference votes and S is the total number of seats needed to be filled in the election (i.e., fractional votes are dropped).
		&&&& If, after all the votes have been transferred, a candidate achieves the quota, then

V(C-Q)/C where V is the value of the vote when the candidate was elected, C is the candidate's vote-total when elected, and Q is quota. 
		&&&& If, after all the votes have been transferred, no candidate achieves the quota, then:
			&&&&& Each candidate with the least vote-total is eliminated, and he is ineligible to receive any additional votes. If there is a tie in the process of elimination, a backwards tiebreaking procedure will be performed to determine the candidate that is eliminated. A backwards tiebreaking procedure views the previous stages in a sequential order and eliminates candidates based on those vote totals.
			&&&&& Each voter's vote (which was cast for these candidates) remains at its present value.
		&&&& Each vote that belonged to the eliminated or elected candidate(s) is transferred to the voter's next preference at its present value.
			&&&&& If this candidate is one who was previously eliminated or elected, Section 9.0.4.e. is repeated.
			&&&&& If the voter has not listed any additional preference or was unable to do so, his ballot is exhausted.
		&&&& Section 9.0.4.c. through 9.0.4.e. are repeated until:
			&&&&& All of the seats are filled by election; or
			&&&&& At the end of Section 9.0.4.d., if the number of eligible candidates is equal to or less than the number of unfilled seats and there is no candidate who can reach the quota, then the election is stopped and those seats are considered vacant and a by-election is held immediately following with the timeline at the CRO's discretion.
		&&&& If ``Re-Open Nominations'' receives equal to or more than Q votes, the election iterations are stopped and the unfilled seats are reopened in a by-election.
