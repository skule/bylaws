# Referenda

## General
1. When voting on a referendum, a voter may only choose to vote "Yes", vote "No", or spoil their ballot. Spoiling a ballot means that it counts towards the quorum required for the referendum result to be valid, but does not count for or against the simple majority required for the result to take effect.
   1. For example, if out of 100 eligible voters, two people vote "Yes", one person votes "No", and two people spoil their ballots, then a 5% quorum is met (5 votes were cast) and the result is in favor (2/3 unspoiled ballots were in favor).
1. For the purposes of other chapters, the following parties are all considered "candidates" for referenda and can receive warnings and be disqualified in accordance with Chapter 9. "Disqualification" in the case of a referendum means invalidating all votes for the respective option:
   1. A student group financially supported by a levy referendum (as noted in Section 6.1.5), for the "Yes" option.
   1. The party calling a recall referendum, for the "Yes" option.
   1. The person facing recall in a recall referendum, for the "No" option.
1. Referendum rules not specified in this chapter shall be decided by the CRO with the Speaker's approval.

## Levy Referenda
1. A referendum for the purpose of creating, renewing, increasing, decreasing, or removing student fees as specified in [Bylaw 1 Section 1.3](bylaw-1.md) must be called by one of:
   1. A two-thirds majority vote at a Board of Directors Meeting; or
   1. A simple majority vote at a General Meeting.
1. The question text of such a referendum shall contain exclusively the following elements:
   1. The question of support (e.g. "Do you support ... ?")
   1. The fee in question (e.g. "levy for [student group]")
   1. The amount of the fee in each semester per full-time and part-time student, and the resulting amount in each year (e.g. "$1.50 per semester per student for both Fall and Winter semesters, for a total of $3.00 annually")
   1. The sessions during which the fee will be levied (e.g. "the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 terms")
   1. Example question text: "Do you support a $1.50 per semester per student levy for [student group] for the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 terms? ($1.50 per semester per student for both Fall and Winter semesters, for a total of $3.00 annually.)"
1. The campaign and voting periods for such a referendum shall run concurrently with the Spring Elections cycle following when it is called.
1. The party calling such a referendum may provide, when calling the referendum, a document in support of the referendum, to which a link will appear alongside the referendum question when it is presented to voters.
1. If the fee in question is to financially support a specific student group, the following campaign rules apply to the student group:
   1. Section 8.0, Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 8.6, and Section 8.7 apply in full, with the following exceptions:
      1. Social media accounts need not be new (contrary to Section 8.2.2.a).
      1. Social media accounts may continue to be active after the campaign period (contrary to Section 8.2.5), but may not post further campaign material.
      1. The student group may use its own logos and endorse itself (contrary to Section 8.3), but its members may not publicly endorse it.
      1. Campaign messages may be posted in the student group's own internal channels (contrary to Section 8.6.5) but still may not be posted in other groups not created for the purpose of campaigning.
   1. Physical campaign materials and in-class speeches, as outlined in Section 8.1 and Section 8.4 respectively, are not allowed.
   1. Section 8.5 does not apply. Any member of the student group may assist with its campaign.
1. Such a referendum which receives votes from at least 5% of Members, of which a simple majority are in favor, shall lead to the fee being modified as proposed. Otherwise, the referendum fails.

## Referenda to Recall a Class Representative
1. A referendum to recall a Class Representative must be called by a Referendum Form submitted to the Engineering Society Office consisting of a list of signatures of Regular Members in the Class Representative's constituency, which contains:
   1. Each signer's name and student number; and

## General

1. There shall be a "Re-Open Nominations" option on each ballot whose effect is described in section 11.1.7.
1. There shall be an option on each ballot to spoil it entirely. The number of spoiled ballots in each election is recorded, but otherwise spoiled ballots do not count towards the results in any way (except in referenda, as specified in section 6.0.1).
1. Ballots that contain a mark for only one candidate shall be considered to contain a single first-place vote for that candidate.
1. The following elections shall be held under a Gregory method of Single Transferable Vote system: Officers, Board of Directors, Discipline Club Chairs, Class Representatives, and any other electronic elections at the discretion of the CRO, as described in Section 11.1.

## Voting Method
1. Each voter's first preference candidate receives one (1) vote.
1. The quota of votes needed to win is calculated using the Droop quota, (N/(S+1))+1, where N is the number of valid first-preference votes in the first round and S is the total number of seats needed to be filled in the election (i.e., fractional votes are dropped). The quota does not change through subsequent rounds.
1. If, after all the votes have been transferred, a candidate achieves the quota, then:
   1. They are elected to a seat and are ineligible to receive any more votes.
   1. Their votes are transferred to the voter's next preference at a value of V(C-Q)/C where V is the value of the vote when the candidate was elected, C is the candidate's vote-total when elected, and Q is quota.
1. If, after all the votes have been transferred, no candidate achieves the quota, then:
   1. Each candidate with the lowest vote-total is eliminated, and they are ineligible to receive any additional votes. If there is a tie in the process of elimination, a backwards tie-breaking procedure will be performed to determine the candidate that is eliminated. A backwards tie-breaking procedure views the previous stages in a sequential order and eliminates candidates based on those vote totals.
   1. Each voter's vote (which was cast for these candidates) remains at its present value.
1. Each vote that belonged to the eliminated or elected candidate(s) is transferred to the voter's next preference at its present value.
   1. If this candidate is one who was previously eliminated or elected, Section 11.1.5. is repeated.
   1. If the voter has not listed any additional preference or was unable to do so, their ballot is exhausted.
1. Section 11.1.3. through Section 11.1.5. are repeated until:
   1. All of the seats are filled by election; or
   1. At the end of Section 11.1.4., if the number of eligible candidates is equal to or less than the number of unfilled seats and there is no candidate who can reach the quota, then the election is stopped, the unfilled seats are considered vacant, and a by-election is held immediately following with the timeline at the CRO's discretion.
1. If "Re-Open Nominations" receives equal to or more than Q votes, the election iterations are stopped and the unfilled seats are reopened in a by-election.
1. In the event a candidate withdraws or is disqualified between the start of the voting period and the ratification of election results:
   1. Any votes cast where the candidate was the first-preference and there were no further preferences stated will be nullified and will not count towards the quota.
